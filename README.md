# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Autumn Abernathy. I am currently working on a tech degree through Treehouse. I hope to sharpen my skills and learn to make more advanced websites. After I earn my certificate I plan to start building my portfolio through doing websites for family and friends. After building my portfolio I will move onto freelancing or land a job as a web developer.
